I'm a dedicated student currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Data Science. I enjoy working with data, exploring patterns, and building practical solutions using programming and analytical tools. With a strong foundation in Python and an interest in intelligent systems, I'm focused on developing skills that blend logic, structure, and data-driven decision-making.

Always curious and committed to continuous learning, I'm looking forward to opportunities where I can apply what I learn to real-world challenges.
